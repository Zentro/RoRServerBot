## RoRServerBot

**RoRServerBot** is the bot designed to manage and enhance how you interact with your Rigs of Rods server. It provides seamless server control, real-time chat monitoring, and easy interaction for server owners and players alike… all through the convenience of Discord!

Built fully asynchronous and following Pythonic best practices, it delivers speed, stability, and clean code.

## Quick start

[!NOTE]
It's assumed you already have Python installed. If you don’t, follow [this guide](#) to install Python first.

The original RoRServerBot was created using Python 2 and has been gradually updated over time to support newer Python versions.

With this new v2 rewrite, the bot was designed for ease of use. Installing it is simple:

```sh
pip install rorserverbot
```

Or if you prefer to install via the built wheel (replace the 2.x.x with the actual version):

```sh
pip install rorserverbot-2.x.x-py3-none-any.whl
```

That’s it! The required dependencies and everything else will be installed automatically.
